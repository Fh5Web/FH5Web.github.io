            <p class="des1">Cars
              <p class="des2">Players can choose from a selection of cars; buggies, rally cars, concept cars, trucks, and road cars.
                A complete UX overhaul brings the experience in-line with modern image manipulation software. 100 new rims, hundreds of new visual upgrades, and thousands of performance upgrades have been added.
                Players can equip a car horn to any vehicle from a selection of various available standard horns, musical horns, and sound effects.
                Send and receive gifts from the community. Players can take one of their cars, apply upgrades and a paint job, and then drop it as a gift to another player.</p>

            <p class="des1">Tuning
              <p class="des2">When it comes to tuning in Horizon the most important aspect you need to understand is the concept of car types and body types.
                Car types provide a general classification of all cars in Forza and group several body types. Each car type needs a distinctive way to be setup in terms of tuning.
                Generally Horizon distinguishes between road, race, rally and off-road cars.
                Tuning gives you the ability to change the cars handling and performance to suit your needs and desires and create the perfect car for your perfect experience.

              <p class="des2">The Horizon Festival Mexico is a music and motoring celebration held by Horizon within Mexico. 
                Players arrive at the festival and are greeted with the expansive landscape of Mexico, hundreds of cars to choose from, and a multitude of other racers at the festival to compete or co-operate with in events.
                The Festival Playlist is a monthly rotating selection of challenges and rewards, with each Series offering a differing set of goals for players to beat and earn rewards across all four seasons.
